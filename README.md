## Description of Application
The Code Quiz uses DOM manipulation to ask the user a series of questions while a countdown times them. The score of questions correct is recorded and if a question is answered incorrectly the user loses 10 seconds.

## Challenges Faced
Throughout the creation of this application I have faced many challenges. The main challenge I faced was due to errors faced with DOM element creation impacting the function of on click events.
